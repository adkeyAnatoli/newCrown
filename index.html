                Crown Casino was founded in 2019. TechSolutions Group NV
                currently owns the casino. Curacao licenses Crown Casino. The
                jurisdiction of Curacao occupies an important place among the
                licensing authorities, and its license means the safety of the
                gambling platform. Our team has analyzed Crown Casino on
                essential parameters to prepare an honest review for you. The
                first impression of the casino is created when you enter the
                site. The site is designed in dark shades using black and gold
                colors. In addition, animated windows on the main page tell
                about promotions and attract players' attention. Players can log
                in to their accounts or register in the upper right corner. The
                main menu is at the top of the Crown Casino Online homepage,
                where the games are sorted into categories. In the same part of
                the page, you can see current promotions. On the left side of
                the page is a menu to view available payment systems, read the
                user agreement, and other important information. The site is
                only available in many languages. Next, we will take a closer
                look at some of Crown Casino's other parameters.

                address and password.
              </li>
              <li class="text">
                You must enter account information such as your name, date of
                birth, and phone number.
              </li>
              <li class="text">

              bonus code. This box is helpful for subsequent deposits, but the
              welcome bonus on the first deposit does not require a code.
              Instead, there is a welcome bonus button at the top of the deposit
              screen. This button is pressed automatically. You must click on
              the No Bonus button if you do not want to activate the welcome
              bonus. Once your deposit and bonus have been sent, you will be
              ready to play online Crown casino games. So what are you waiting

            Crown casino online has more than 3000 games. This site includes
            slots, blackjack, roulette, live dealer games, video poker, keno,
            and scratch cards. You can also enjoy unique options like

            there is a good chance that Crown Casino online casino has several
            options available. The problem with sites with so many games
            available is that you can't find the matches that interest you.
            Luckily, Crown Casino has done an excellent job of organizing its
            site in a way that is easy to navigate. We will continue our Crown

                It is probably the largest and most popular category of games.
                It contains about 700 exciting video slots from the best
                manufacturers. Unfortunately, there is no way to sort games by
                the manufacturer at Crown casino. However, you can find the
                match you need on your own. All games on the Crown casino site
                are placed in the category "slots" or otherwise "pokies" and are
                presented in the form of a table. Crown Casino offers slots from
                Microgaming (Banana Odyssey, Elemental Beasts), NetEnt (Reel
                rush 2, Ozzy Osbourne), 1x2Gaming (9 Mask Of Fire, Conan), and

                Crown Casino's policy regarding progressive jackpot slots is
                incredibly impressive. According to the Terms and Conditions
                page, "all progressive jackpot winnings will be paid out in
                full." It is a unique policy because many online casinos choose
                to pay out the jackpot gradually. When you play at Crown Casino,
                you don't have to worry about cashing out thousands of dollars
                at a time for years. It is still important to familiarize
                yourself with the terms and conditions of playing the jackpot.
                There may be rules regarding the withdrawal methods used to pay
                the jackpot. Players from certain countries, including China and
                India, are not eligible to play the Jackpot games. In some
                cases, players can win jackpots from some software providers but
                not from others. If you agree to these terms, many jackpot games
                are available. The easiest way to find them is to type the word
                jackpot in the search bar.

            dumped in the "casino" section. There are a little less than a
            hundred games in this category. Some games are demo-based (European
            Roulette, 3D Blackjack, Premier Roulette, and Spanish Blackjack),
            while others require registration on the site. Crown casino online
            offers its visitors to play blackjack (European Blackjack, 3D

                Crown Casino is not limited to traditional casino games. Sure,
                there are thousands of slots, table games, and poker options,
                but that's not all that this online casino site has to offer.
                Crown Casino has a wide selection of specialty games, including
                bingo, keno, digital scratch cards, and Plinko. Aviator is one
                of the unique gaming options that makes Crown Casino stand out.
                It allows you to bet as much as you want while the plane flies
                across the screen. Then, when the plane takes off randomly, the
                number it is under will win. You can collect your winnings if
                you place a bet on this number. Many of these games are listed
                in the quick games category, but not all. If you're looking for
                bingo, keno, or scratch cards, the easiest way to find them is
                to search for those terms. Evoplay Entertainment and Spribe are
                noteworthy software providers because they create so many unique
                gaming options.

          <h2 class="title-black">Loyalty program</h2>
          <p class="text">
            Players who play regularly at Crown Casino can take part in a very
            generous loyalty program that will allow them to increase their
            chances of making a profit. The VIP program at Crown Casino is more
            than impressive and consists of 9 levels. Once you reach the ninth
            level, you should expect a lot of rewards. The moment you make your
            first deposit, you become a Crown Casino Loyalty Program member. At
            this point, you're probably wondering what you need to do to level
            up, and the answer is simple: all you have to do is play your
            favorite games. For every €12.50 wagered, you get 1 point. Once you
            accumulate enough points, you can exchange them for real money. The
            exchange will depend on the level you are at that moment. All prizes
            require a 3x wagering requirement, and extra points need a 1x
            wagering requirement. And every time you level up, you will receive
            rewards:
